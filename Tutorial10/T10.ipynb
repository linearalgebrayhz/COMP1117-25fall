    "Computer programming (or more broadly, Computer Sceience) is a vast field. COMP1117 only covers a small portion of programming with Python that is far from enough for you to become a proficient programmer or developer. CS requires a huge amount of self-learning and practice with projects which are hard to be covered in most HKU courses.\n",

    "I think the most valuable part for CS61A is the 4 course projects. They are:\n",
    "- Hog: A simple game simulator.\n",

    "- Ant: A game resembles Plant vs Zombies.\n",
    "- Scheme: use Python to implement a Scheme interpreter.\n",

Although AI tools are not allowed in the assessments of COMP1117, I strongly recommend you to explore and use them to help your learning and programming in the future. The most advanced AI agents are now able to autonomously write, test, and debug code with minimal human input. You can try github copilot agent (covered in your Github student developer pack)\n",
