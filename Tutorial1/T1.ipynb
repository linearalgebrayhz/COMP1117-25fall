    "So far, you might be using **IDLE** (Python’s built-in editor). While it’s simple, most programmers prefer a modern **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** like [**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for long-term projects. \n",

    "- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.  \n",

    "- **Extensible**: Thousands of extensions (Python, Git, Jupyter, Markdown, etc.).  \n",
